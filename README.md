# LSTM-Federated-Learning
This project involves the development and optimization of an LSTM model for 5-hour forecasts on real agricultural or signal time series (2000-3000 entries). The model is integrated into a custom-made Hierarchical Federated Learning framework using Flower, resulting in a 94.2% improvement in performance compared to local models
