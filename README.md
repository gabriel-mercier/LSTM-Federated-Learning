# Agricultural Time Series Prediction using LSTM and Federated Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an LSTM model for time series prediction of soil humidity, leveraging a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework. The goal is to predict future soil conditions for more effective agricultural decision-making.

## Data

    <td><img src="images/data1.png" alt="Image 1" width="250"/></td>
    <td><img src="images/data1.png" alt="Image 2" width="250"/></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/data1.png" alt="Image 3" width="250"/></td>
    <td><img src="images/data1.png" alt="Image 4" width="250"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

- **Source**: Real-world agricultural sensor data (soil humidity), collected across multiple clients.
- **Challenges**: Small datasets, missing values, and noise.
- **Preprocessing**: 
  - Suppression of peak and zero values.
  - Rolling average to reduce noise.
  - Interpolation for missing data.
  - Feature engineering to detect when crops are watered.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture was fine-tuned to achieve the best results, with key hyperparameters being:

- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Learning Rate**: 0.005 (Adam optimizer)
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Variable Hyperparameters**: 
  - Number of layers
  - Units per layer
  - Number of input time steps (`n_step_in`)

## Federated Learning (HFL) Implementation

This project integrates **Flower**, a federated learning framework, to facilitate training across multiple clients and servers:

- **Local Models**: Each client trains a model on their local data.
- **Local Servers**: Aggregate models from clients within the serverâ€™s scope.
- **Global Server**: Aggregates local server models to produce a global model.

### Results:

- **Local Model Performance**: Local models suffered from lack of data, but served as useful benchmarks.
- **Global Model**: Significant improvement in performance when aggregating across clients and servers.
